# **ETL Python Scripts for Crypto Market Data Analysis**

## Overview
This project comprises a suite of three Python scripts, each tailored for specific aspects of data handling and analysis in the realm of cryptocurrency markets. The scripts are designed with reusability and scalability in mind, making them ideal for both educational purposes and practical applications in data science and financial analysis.

### **1. API2CSV: Data Extraction and Transformation**
> - **Functionality**: This script efficiently interfaces with cryptocurrency market APIs to fetch and store historical market data. 
> - **Features**: 
>   - Retrieves five years of historical price data for Solana (SOL) against USD (SolUsd).
>   - Converts and saves the data into a CSV format.
>   - Target directory: `C:\temp` for easy access and management.
> - **Use Case**: Ideal for analysts requiring historical data for backtesting trading strategies, studying market trends, or conducting financial research.

### **2. CSV2Database: Data Integration**
> - **Functionality**: Seamlessly integrates CSV data into a relational database system.
> - **Features**:
>   - Automates the process of importing CSV files.
>   - Compatible with PostgreSQL, a robust and widely-used SQL database.
>   - Ensures data integrity and efficient storage.
> - **Use Case**: Perfect for database administrators and data engineers looking to incorporate flat-file data into SQL databases for complex querying and data management.

### **3. CSV2Visualizations: Data Visualization**
> - **Functionality**: Transforms data into insightful visual representations.
> - **Features**:
>   - Generates visualizations focusing on price action, market volatility, and trading volume.
>   - Offers customizable visualization options to cater to specific analytical needs.
> - **Use Case**: Designed for data analysts and financial experts interested in visualizing market dynamics and identifying patterns in cryptocurrency markets.

## **Technical Stack**
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: (Specify any libraries or frameworks used, e.g., Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization, psycopg2 for PostgreSQL integration)
- **APIs**: (Detail the APIs used for data retrieval)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Visualization Tools**: (Specify tools or libraries used for visualizations, if any)

## **Getting Started**
(Include basic instructions on how to set up and run the scripts, any prerequisites like Python version, library installations, etc.)

## **Contribution and Customization**
This project is open for contributions and can be easily customized to suit various data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) needs in different domains. Feel free to fork, modify, and use these scripts as a foundation for your data processing tasks.
